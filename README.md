# Emotion-Music

My first hackathon project :)

You give the website a photo of yourself as input, and it recommends music for you based on your current mood (happy, sad, angry, etc.)

Credits to my teammates at U of T Hacks 2018: Arielle Shannon, Taaha Hassan, and Damian Bhatia, as well as additional help from Steven Mai and Arif Aulakh.
