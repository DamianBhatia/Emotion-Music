# Emotion-Music

My first hackathon project :)

You give the website a photo of yourself as input, and it recommends music for you based on your current mood (happy, sad, angry, etc.)

Credits to my hackathon teammates Arielle Shannon, Taaha Hassan, and Damian Bhatia, as well as additional help from Steven Mai and Arif Aulakh.
